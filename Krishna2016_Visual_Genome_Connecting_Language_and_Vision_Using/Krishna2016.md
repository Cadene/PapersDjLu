108,249 images from the intersection of YFCC100M (Thomee et al. 2015) and MSCOCO

For each image, an average of 17 question-answer pairs are collected

there are 1.7 million QA pairs of the 6W question types (what, where, when, who, why, and how)

compare to VQA dataset, Visual Genome represents a more balanced distribution of the 6W question types.

Moreover, the aver-age question and answer lengths for Visual Genomeare larger than the VQA dataset.
