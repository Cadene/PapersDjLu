	abstract = {Object localization is an important computer vision problem with a variety of
applications. The lack of large scale object-level annotations and the relative
abundance of image-level labels makes a compelling case for weak supervision in
the object localization task. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of
state-of-the-art methods for the related problem of object recognition. In this
paper, we describe a novel object localization algorithm which uses
classification networks trained on only image labels. This weakly supervised
method leverages local spatial and semantic patterns captured in the
convolutional layers of classification networks. We propose an efficient beam
search based approach to detect and localize multiple objects in images. The
proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in standard
object localization data-sets with a 8 point increase in mAP scores.},
