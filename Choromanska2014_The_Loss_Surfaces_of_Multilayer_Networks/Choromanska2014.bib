	abstract = {We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a
simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the
Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i)
variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii)
uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully
decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix
theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical
values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are
located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number
of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the
network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar
behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies
in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge
to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there
are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a
major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter
poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered.
Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the
network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum
often leads to overfitting.},
