	abstract = {We address a learning-to-normalize problem by proposing Switchable
Normalization (SN), which learns to select different operations for different
normalization layers of a deep neural network (DNN). SN switches among three
distinct scopes to compute statistics (means and variances) including a
channel, a layer, and a minibatch, by learning their importance weights in an
end-to-end manner. SN has several good properties. First, it adapts to various
network architectures and tasks (see Fig.1). Second, it is robust to a wide
range of batch sizes, maintaining high performance when small minibatch is
presented (e.g. 2 images/GPU). Third, SN treats all channels as a group, unlike
group normalization that searches the number of groups as a hyper-parameter.
Without bells and whistles, SN outperforms its counterparts on various
challenging problems, such as image classification in ImageNet, object
detection and segmentation in COCO, artistic image stylization, and neural
architecture search. We hope SN will help ease the usages and understand the
effects of normalization techniques in deep learning. The code of SN will be
made available in https://github.com/switchablenorms/.},
