	abstract = {Neural networks have recently had a lot of success for many tasks. However,
neural network architectures that perform well are still typically designed
manually by experts in a cumbersome trial-and-error process. We propose a new
method to automatically search for well-performing CNN architectures based on a
simple hill climbing procedure whose operators apply network morphisms,
followed by short optimization runs by cosine annealing. Surprisingly, this
simple method yields competitive results, despite only requiring resources in
the same order of magnitude as training a single network. E.g., on CIFAR-10,
our method designs and trains networks with an error rate below 6% in only 12
hours on a single GPU; training for one day reduces this error further, to
almost 5%.},
