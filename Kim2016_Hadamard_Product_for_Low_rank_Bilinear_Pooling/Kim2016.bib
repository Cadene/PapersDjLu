	abstract = {Bilinear models provide rich representations compared to linear models. They
have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition,
segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art
performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However,
bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the
applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear
neural networks using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), commonly
implemented in many scientific computing frameworks. We show that our model
outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks, having
a better parsimonious property.},
