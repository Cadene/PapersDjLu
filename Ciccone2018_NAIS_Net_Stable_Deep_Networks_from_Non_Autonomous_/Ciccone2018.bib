	abstract = {This paper introduces Non-Autonomous Input-Output Stable Network (NAIS-Net),
a very deep architecture where each stacked processing block is derived from a
time-invariant non-autonomous dynamical system. Non-autonomy is implemented by
skip connections from the block input to each of the unrolled processing stages
and allows stability to be enforced so that blocks can be unrolled adaptively
to a pattern-dependent processing depth. NAIS-Net induces non-trivial,
Lipschitz input-output maps, even for an infinite unroll length. We prove that
the network is globally asymptotically stable so that for every initial
condition there is exactly one input-dependent equilibrium assuming tanh units,
and multiple stable equilibria for ReL units. An efficient implementation that
enforces the stability under derived conditions for both fully-connected and
convolutional layers is also presented. Experimental results show how NAIS-Net
exhibits stability in practice, yielding a significant reduction in
generalization gap compared to ResNets.},
