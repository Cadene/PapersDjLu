	abstract = {The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest unsolved
challenges in computer science. In this paper, we propose some fundamental
properties these machines should have, focusing in particular on communication
and learning. We discuss a simple environment that could be used to
incrementally teach a machine the basics of natural-language-based
communication, as a prerequisite to more complex interaction with human users.
We also present some conjectures on the sort of algorithms the machine should
support in order to profitably learn from the environment.},
