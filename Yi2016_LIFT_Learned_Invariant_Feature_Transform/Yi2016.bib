	abstract = {We introduce a novel Deep Network architecture that implements the full
feature point handling pipeline, that is, detection, orientation estimation,
and feature description. While previous works have successfully tackled each
one of these problems individually, we show how to learn to do all three in a
unified manner while preserving end-to-end differentiability. We then
demonstrate that our Deep pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a
number of benchmark datasets, without the need of retraining.},
