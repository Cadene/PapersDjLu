	abstract = {The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art solution
for large-scale visual recognition. Following basic principles such as
increasing the depth and constructing highway connections, researchers have
manually designed a lot of fixed network structures and verified their
effectiveness.
  In this paper, we discuss the possibility of learning deep network structures
automatically. Note that the number of possible network structures increases
exponentially with the number of layers in the network, which inspires us to
adopt the genetic algorithm to efficiently traverse this large search space. We
first propose an encoding method to represent each network structure in a
fixed-length binary string, and initialize the genetic algorithm by generating
a set of randomized individuals. In each generation, we define standard genetic
operations, e.g., selection, mutation and crossover, to eliminate weak
individuals and then generate more competitive ones. The competitiveness of
each individual is defined as its recognition accuracy, which is obtained via
training the network from scratch and evaluating it on a validation set. We run
the genetic process on two small datasets, i.e., MNIST and CIFAR10,
demonstrating its ability to evolve and find high-quality structures which are
little studied before. These structures are also transferrable to the
large-scale ILSVRC2012 dataset.},
