There is well-known early theoretical work on the representational capacity of neural
nets. For example, it was proved that a network with a large enough single hidden layer of sigmoid
units can approximate any decision boundary[4]. Empirical work, however, shows that it is difficult
to train shallow nets to be as accurate as deep nets. For vision tasks, a recent study on deep convolutional
nets suggests that deeper models are preferred under a parameter budget [7].
