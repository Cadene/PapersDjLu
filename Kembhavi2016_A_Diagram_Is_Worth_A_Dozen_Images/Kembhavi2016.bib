	abstract = {Diagrams are common tools for representing complex concepts, relationships
and events, often when it would be difficult to portray the same information
with natural images. Understanding natural images has been extensively studied
in computer vision, while diagram understanding has received little attention.
In this paper, we study the problem of diagram interpretation and reasoning,
the challenging task of identifying the structure of a diagram and the
semantics of its constituents and their relationships. We introduce Diagram
Parse Graphs (DPG) as our representation to model the structure of diagrams. We
define syntactic parsing of diagrams as learning to infer DPGs for diagrams and
study semantic interpretation and reasoning of diagrams in the context of
diagram question answering. We devise an LSTM-based method for syntactic
parsing of diagrams and introduce a DPG-based attention model for diagram
question answering. We compile a new dataset of diagrams with exhaustive
annotations of constituents and relationships for over 5,000 diagrams and
15,000 questions and answers. Our results show the significance of our models
for syntactic parsing and question answering in diagrams using DPGs.},
