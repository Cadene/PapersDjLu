	abstract = {Generic object detection, aiming at locating object instances from a large
number of predefined categories in natural images, is one of the most
fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision. Deep learning
techniques have emerged in recent years as powerful methods for learning
feature representations directly from data, and have led to remarkable
breakthroughs in the field of generic object detection. Given this time of
rapid evolution, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of
the recent achievements in this field brought by deep learning techniques. More
than 250 key contributions are included in this survey, covering many aspects
of generic object detection research: leading detection frameworks and
fundamental subproblems including object feature representation, object
proposal generation, context information modeling and training strategies;
evaluation issues, specifically benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and
state of the art performance. We finish by identifying promising directions for
future research.},
