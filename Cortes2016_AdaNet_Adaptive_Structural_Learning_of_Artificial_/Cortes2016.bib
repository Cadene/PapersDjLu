	abstract = {We present a new theoretical framework for analyzing and learning artificial
neural networks. Our approach simultaneously and adaptively learns both the
structure of the network as well as its weights. The methodology is based upon
and accom- panied by strong data-dependent theoretical learning guarantees, so
that the final network architecture provably adapts to the complexity of any
given problem.},
