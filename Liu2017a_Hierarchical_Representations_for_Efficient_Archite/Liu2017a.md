Almost like [Progressive Neural Architecture Search](http://www.djlu.fr/paper/Cadene/Liu2017/p64wgdNFKOov1iE3mkxuuFyztS1DK5). Maybe a bit more constraint tho (hierarchical mutations). *We must calculate the number of possible architectures.*

Two optimization algorithms are compared:
- evolutionary search algorithm based on tournament selection (Goldberg & Deb, 1991)
- random search
