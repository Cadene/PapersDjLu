	abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel deep networks for traffic sign
classification that achieves outstanding performance on GTSRB surpassing all
previous methods. Our deep network consists of spatial transformer layers and a
modified version of inception module specifically designed for capturing local
and global features together. This features adoption allows our network to
classify precisely intra class samples even under deformations. Use of spatial
transformer layer make this network more robust to deformations such as
translation, rotation, scaling of input images. Unlike existing approaches that
are developed with hand crafted features, multiple deep networks with huge
parameters and data augmentations, our method addresses the concern of
exploding parameters and augmentations. We have achieved state-of-the-art
performance of 99.81\\\% on GTSRB dataset.},
