	abstract = {We tackle the problem of large scale visual place recognition, where the task
is to quickly and accurately recognize the location of a given query
photograph. We present the following three principal contributions. First, we
develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in
an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main
component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer,
inspired by the "Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors" image representation
commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN
architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we develop a
training procedure, based on a new weakly supervised ranking loss, to learn
parameters of the architecture in an end-to-end manner from images depicting
the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine.
Finally, we show that the proposed architecture obtains a large improvement in
performance over non-learnt image representations, significantly outperforms
off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on two challenging place recognition benchmarks,
and outperforms current state-of-the-art compact image representations on
standard image retrieval benchmarks.},
